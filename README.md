# scCOVID-19: A cellular and molecular atlas of COVID-19 initiation in human lung
Early stages of deadly respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 have been challenging to elucidate due to the lack of an experimental system that recapitulates the cellular and structural complexity of the human lung, while allowing precise control over disease initiation and systematic interrogation of molecular events at cellular resolution. Here we show healthy human lung slices cultured ex vivo can be productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the cellular tropism of the virus and its distinct and dynamic effects on host cell gene expression can be determined by single cell RNA sequencing and reconstruction of “infection pseudotime” for individual lung cell types.
